{"q1":"My name is Miles!",
"q2":"I'm kindof excited to meet a new roommate. I tend to be pretty introverted so I'm always worried that I'll meet someone I'm not compatable with. That just makes everyone unhappy.",
"q3":"It really depends on the person. When I don't like a person we really don't work well together, but I have a few very close friends who know everything about my life. I don't get along well with assholes, or people who are overly bossy. ",
"q4":"Hopefully we'd just live well together. I'd rather have someone who's not too messy, not too loud, and doesn't bring friends around at all hours than someone who's my best friend but hell to live with. So I'd prioritize roommate compatability over friendship. ",
"q5":"I study Computer Science and possibly Linguistics. I tend to study during most of my spare time, which perplexes some people. I'm very dedicated to my classes, unless I don't care about the subject matter. In that case, I couldnt' care less and I\"ll often lean on other people to pass the class. ",
"q6":"I like my room to be a comfortable 'me' space. I dont' usually study there, since it gets a bit too messy, but I like to relax in my bed and watch netflix during my self-care hours. I really value quietness and space, so a quiet roommate is preferable. ",
"q7":"I definitely like hanging out with close friends or chilling and recharging in my room over the weekend. When and if I go out, it's usually on a Thursday or Friday night and I'm back before too long. I don't like spending money on that much. ",
"q8":"Probably, though I tend to be passive-agressive. I'd rather just ignore each other if we don't get along then put time and effort towards working out our problems. After all, being a roommate is temporary. ",
"q9":"I'd like my roommate to be able to handle me at my worst. If there's no time to get someone else to help me, I hope they're able to do so. That said, I dont need them to be my day-in day-out support.",
"q10":"A have some hard days, but I generally go to my closest friends for support. The stress of school is constant. ",
"q11":"I'm absolutely looking forward to college! I can't wait to study and learn and go to bed early and be a good student!"}
